                <h2>Happy Halloween</h2>
                <p>Halloween is thought to have influences from Christian
                    beliefs and practices. The English word 'Halloween'
                    comes from "All Hallows' Eve", being the evening before the
                    Christian holy days of All Hallows' Day (All Saints' Day) on
                    1 November and All Souls' Day on 2 November. Since the
                    time of the early Church, major feasts in Christianity
                    (such as Christmas, Easter and Pentecost) had vigils that
                    began the night before, as did the feast of All Hallows'.
                    These three days are collectively called Allhallowtide and
                    are a time when Western Christians honour all saints and
                    pray for recently departed souls who have yet to reach
                    Heaven. Commemorations of all saints and martyrs were held
                    by several churches on various dates, mostly in
                    springtime. In 4th-century Roman Edessa it was held on
                    13 May, and on 13 May 609, Pope Boniface IV re-dedicated the
                    Pantheon in Rome to "St Mary and all martyrs". This was
                    the date of Lemuria, an ancient Roman festival of the
                    dead.

                    In the 8th century, Pope Gregory III (731â€“741) founded an
                    oratory in St Peter's for the relics
                    "of the holy apostles and of all saints, martyrs and confessors".
                    Some sources say it was dedicated on 1 November, while
                    others say it was on Palm Sunday in April 732. By
                    800, there is evidence that churches in Ireland and
                    Northumbria were holding a feast commemorating all saints on
                    1 November. Alcuin of Northumbria, a member of
                    Charlemagne's court, may then have introduced this 1
                    November date in the Frankish Empire.In 835, it became
                    the official date in the Frankish Empire. Some suggest
                    this was due to Celtic influence, while others suggest it
                    was a Germanic idea although it is claimed that both
                    Germanic and Celtic-speaking peoples commemorated the dead
                    at the beginning of winter. They may have seen it as the
                    most fitting time to do so, as it is a time of 'dying' in
                    nature. It is also suggested the change was made on
                    the
                    "practical grounds that Rome in summer could not accommodate the great number of pilgrims who flocked to it",
                    and perhaps because of public health concerns over Roman
                    Fever, which claimed a number of lives during Rome's sultry
                    summers.</p>
